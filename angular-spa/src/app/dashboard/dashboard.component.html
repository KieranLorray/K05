    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models designed to generate new content, such as text, images, music, or even videos, that closely mimics human creativity. Unlike traditional AI models that are primarily built for tasks like classification or regression, generative AI models create something novel based on patterns learned from data. One of the most well-known examples is OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models, which can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts.

Generative AI operates through machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, where large neural networks are trained on vast datasets. These models learn the underlying structures and relationships within the data, allowing them to generate new, realistic examples that resemble the original training data. Variants of generative AI, like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), consist of two neural networks that compete with each other, enhancing the quality of generated content.

The applications of generative AI are vast and growing. In content creation, it’s used for writing, art, and music composition. In industries like healthcare and design, it’s used to generate drug compounds or create innovative designs. However, concerns around ethical implications, misinformation, and copyright infringement have sparked discussions about regulation and safe use of these technologies.

    <h2>Technical Aspects of the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This application is built using Angular as the frontend framework and Node.js as
      the backend. The backend API is hosted on port 3000, and the frontend is served
      via NGINX. The app communicates with the backend using RESTful HTTP calls and
      implements JWT for secure user authentication.
